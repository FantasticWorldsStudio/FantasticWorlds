# FantasticWorlds
The java game of multiple realms

Welcome to the Fantastic Worlds project! 

What this project aims to do is write a complete server-client set of java applications using java 8 and the jMonkeyEngine to create a set of dynamic linked worlds for fantasy role-playing.

The project is open source and anyone who wants to help should email mark@fantasticworldsstudio.com
Currently there is only one developer working on this project (me).

I could really use someone that knows java networking, and someone fluent in database, so I can work on systems for the game.
